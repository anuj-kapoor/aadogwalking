             <p class="strong" style="color:red;"> Safe Tick Removal</p>
<p class="small">
If you find a tick on your dog, don't panic! Follow these quick and easy steps to safely remove the pest.</p>
<p class="strong" >Step 1: Get your gear</p>
<p class="small"> Pair of gloves
Clean pair of tweezers or a commercial tick remover Antiseptic Isopropyl alcohol</p>
<p class="strong" >Step 2:Remove the tick</p>
<p class="small">Wear gloves while removing the tick to avoid contact with your skin (ticks can transmit diseases to people, too). If you're using tweezers:
Grasp the tick as close to your dog’s skin as possible, but be gentle! Try not to pinch your dog's skin.
Pull outward in a straight, steady motion, making sure that you’ve removed the entire tick, since anything left behind could lead to an infection.
If you're using a tick remover:
Gently press the remover against your dog's skin near the tick. Slide the notch of the remover under the tick.
Continue sliding the remover until the tick is caught in the small end of the notch and is pulled free. (The tick will remain in the bowl of the remover.</p>
<p class="strong" >Step 3:Store the evidence</p>
<p class="small">Drop the tick into a small container that contains isopropyl alcohol (the alcohol will quickly kill the tick), and mark the date on the container. If your dog begins displaying symptoms of a tick-borne illness, your veterinarian may want to identify or test the tick.</p>
<p class="strong" >Step 4: Praise your patient</p>
<p class="small">Clean your dog's skin with antiseptic and make sure to clean your tweezers with isopropyl alcohol. Wash your hands, too! Then give your pup a treat for being a trooper.
Follow up
Keep an eye on the area where the tick was to see if an infection surfaces. If the skin remains irritated or infected, make an appointment with your veterinarian.
Watch your dog for symptoms of tick-borne diseases. Some symptoms include arthritis or lameness that lasts for three to four days, reluctance to move, swollen joints, fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite and neurological problems.

         <p class="strong" style="color:Red;">Tips On Encouraging Feline Water Drinking</p> 
         <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cat.jpg" alt="">
         
         
         <p class="small" >Cats are descended from feline desert dwellers and obtained most of their water from prey. Water consuption is essential to health and housecats are notoriously low-water drinkers.</p>

<p class="small"><b><u> Canned food</u></b> is and excellent way to encourage water intake. Canned food is almost 60% water and most cats love the taste. You can also heat it up slightly in the microwave to bring out the flavor.</p>

<p class="small"><b><u> Water should be changed daily.</u></b> Cats are very sensitive to the taste and temperature of water. Some cats don't like the taste of tap water. Try these alternatives:</p>
<ul classs="small">
<li>Filtered</li>
<li>Distilled</li>
<li>Bottled</li>
<li>Refrigerated</li>
<li>Ice cubes</li>
</ul>


<p class="small"><b><u>Wash bowls daily.</u></b> Cats can be turned off by odors on the edge or inside of the bowl. Stainless steel or ceramic bowls are easier to keep clean, and some cats seem to prefer shallow glass or metal bowls. Keep the bowl filled to the brim, cats have very sensitive whiskers and usually don't enjoy putting their faces all the way into a bowl.</p>

<p class="small">Some cats will drink more if a drop or two of tuna juice (from canned tuna in water) is added to the bowl, or ice cubes made from flavored broth mixed with water. If you try this, make sure to still provide a separate bowl of fresh water.</p>

<p class="small"><b><u>Provide a water source away from the food bowl.</u></b> Cats seem to enjoy drinking water more when it is away from their food dish. This also encourages natural hunting/foraging behaviors to place water in more than one area.</p>

<p class="small"><b><u>Moving water is irresistable to most cats. </u></b>Try leaving a dripping faucet on or purchase a cat water fountain. Fountains are excellent at keeping the water fresh and at keeping your cat entertained. Most pet stores carry cat fountains.</p>

<p class="small">Milk is a good treat if your cat is not lactose intolerant, however cats do not need milk. Water is still the best thing for your cats health.</p>

<p class="small"><b><u>Experiment with your cat.</u></b> Find his/her favorite water habits and encourage them. By keeping your cat hydrated, you can improve your cat's health and extend his life.</p>

<p class="small">Please call your veterinarian if you notice any changes in your cats water intake as this can be an early warning sign for medical problems.</p>

             <div class="small">
             <p style="color:red;">Cover the basics</p>

<p>Secure an up-to-date tag on your pet's collar, and make sure to use a leash when you head outdoors.  Consult your veterinarian for flea and tick control options, and always keep your pet's vaccinations current.  If you go to the dog parks in Chicago, you will need to purchase a dog park tag for each pet.
</p>
 <p style="color:red;">Be wary around water</p>
<p>
Not all dogs are natural swimmers, so watch your pooch when you're near the pool, beach or lake.  On trips to the ocean, make sure your pets don't drink the salt water as it upsets their stomach, just like yours. Remember to watch those currents, even the best paddling dog can struggle against a mean undertow.
</p>
<p style="color:red;">Keep cool</p>
<p>
Schedule walks in the early morning or evening; dog paws hate hot pavement.  You can also make dog exercise sessions safe by stopping for drinks of fresh water and finding shady spots for necessary panting breaks.  Some pet owners also help prevent overheating with short fur shaves for cats and dogs in the summer.
</p>

<p></p>

</div>
<p class="strong" style="color:red;" ><b>Watch for warning signs</b></p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="img/warning.jpg" alt="">
 
 <p class="small">Heat stroke is an issue for pets, too.  
Be on the lookout for early symptoms such as:</p>

<ul class="small">
<li>Excessive panting   </li>          
<li>Drooling</li>
<li>Bright red gums</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Balance problems</li>
<li>Labored breathing</li>
<li>Lethargy</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">You can cool down an overheated pet with cold water or towels, and by offering ice chips or small bowls of water.  Call your veterinarian immediately if these signs continue.</p>
<p class="strong">Safely see the sights</p>

<p class="small">Taking your pets for a ride in the care or minivan? Never leave them inside - windows up or down- on hot days.  Keep dogs' heads in the car while driving.  Inner ear damage, lung infections and injury happen when man's best friend sticks his head out the window.  Buckle up your dog with a harness or seat belt, and never let dogs ride in the back of trucks.  A crate in the truck bed keeps dogs from bouncing out in an accident or being hit with debris on the road.</p>
