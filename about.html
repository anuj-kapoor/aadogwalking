                    <p class="text-left small">My name is Ashley and I spent years trying different jobs before I found my true calling as a dog whisperer.  I had tried everything thing from two short stints at different colleges to  working for a wedding production company to slinging coffee and sandwiches… and even dog biscuits.

And then I responded to an ad for Junior Dog Handler at a Doggie Day Care.  I remember getting hired on the spot and starting the next day. I was so jacked that I was at work for barely an hour when I went outside where the kids cooled themselves off (it was summer) in the swimming pools. My task was to bring “Jumbo” back inside to the playgroup. I figured no problem.  This was my first lesson in you need to know the who, why and how for each individual in the playgroup.  As I entered quite quietly I apparently startled Jumbo, a 190 lb. male St. Bernard. He let out a yelp that could be heard in the next town over.  I thought my career (and possibly my life) could have ended right there and then.  Once I started to talk to him in a calming voice and offered him a Charlie bear, he was a teddy bear. Just like I heard.  Jumbo and I would become close friends in the years to come.  I can still remember him “wading” through the crowded playgroup to get a pet and a Charlie bear.

Some 60 breeds and 5 years later, I have become very confident and know that building relationship with dogs is what I was made for.</p>

I grew up with horses, goats, cats, and dogs living on a farm in Burriville, RI. Now a resident of Lincoln, RI, I own three dogs: a Pitbull and two that are half Shih tzu and half Dachshund. I love all animals and their different personalities. They make me laugh all the time. I started working for AAdogwalking this year because I wanted a job working with animals. It's been a perfect fit; I love being a part of their team. We do it all here: Pet sitting, dog walking, and basic obedience training.

With my experience caring for other domestic animals, such as horses, goats, and cats, you can rest easy, knowing AAdogwalking can meet all of your needs. We cater to our clients and assure you, we will give the same care and attention you would give your 4-legged family members.

Happy walking tails everyone!</p>

When I saw my mom have difficulty keeping her balance because of Parkinsons I started my research on balance service dogs.I decided that a European Great Dane would make a excellent balance service dog for my mom. So I traveled all the way to Maryland to get Mako, a Great Dane puppy so I could start training him for my mom. Eventually I found out that Mako has hip dysplasia.  By the time we found that out, Mako was already one of the family and has become my dog.

I have always had the pleasure of having several dogs in my life and couldn't image living without them. I served as a senior dog handler for over 5 years at a doggy day care. This job was a blast since I got to meet, train and play with hundreds of wonderful dogs. Building a lasting relationship with dozens of these "kids" was a wonderful experience.

This position has lead me to A&amp;A Dog Walking and I am looking forward to meeting dozens of wonderful new friends.</p>

At the age of 4, my aunt made me a tiny Snow White dress.  I refused to take it off for a year because I wanted to be just like her, surrounded by the unconditional love of animals. Over twenty years later, nothing has changed.  From injured wild animals to strays, they've all found ways into my home and heart (much to my mother's dismay in my younger years). I taught horseback riding lessons, nursed reptiles with scale rot back to health, and battled feline cancer. I taught rabbits tricks, quelled the fears of dogs, and showed animals they could love each other as I loved them. Over the years, I've been blessed to care for dogs, cats, horses, goats, rabbits, hamsters, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, sugar gliders, birds, chickens, snakes and bearded dragons. I currently live in Lincoln, RI with my friends Mini the cat, Evie the sugar glider, and Karma a Keeshond puppy.</p>
